Steps to Build a Graph in LangGraph for LLMs
Define the State

The "state" represents the data that flows through the graph and gets updated as it moves between nodes.
To ensure consistency and validate the data, it's recommended to define the state using either TypeDict or Pydantic BaseModel.
This helps maintain a clear structure and avoid errors when working with the data.
Create Functions as Nodes

In LangGraph, functions serve as the nodes of the graph.
Each node has access to the current state and is responsible for performing a specific task.
The function (node) takes the state as input, modifies it as needed, and returns the updated state.
Set Up the Graph Structure

A graph in LangGraph is created by connecting nodes with edges.
The edges define the flow of data between nodes and establish the execution path.
Youâ€™ll define a start node (START) and an end node (END) to create a clear workflow from beginning to completion.
